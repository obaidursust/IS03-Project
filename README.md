# Network Project with Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a basic network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes a **DHCP server** that dynamically assigns IP addresses to end devices.

## Project Overview

In this network topology, a DHCP server is used to automatically assign IP addresses to client devices (such as PCs and laptops), ensuring that each device receives a unique IP address without the need for manual configuration. This project aims to simplify the management of IP addresses within a network using dynamic allocation via DHCP.

## Features
- **DHCP Server**: Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server addresses to devices.
- **Multiple End Devices**: Various devices (PCs, laptops) are connected and configured to obtain their IP configuration automatically from the DHCP server.
- **Router and Switch Configuration**: The network consists of routers and switches to efficiently route traffic between devices.
  
## Network Topology

- **Router**: Connects the network to an external network or simulates an internet connection.
- **Switch**: Connects multiple end devices (PCs, laptops) within the local network.
- **DHCP Server**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to all devices in the network.
- **End Devices**: Devices like PCs and laptops that receive IP addresses from the DHCP server.

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: This project was created and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer.
